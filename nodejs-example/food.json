In those areas that used to be under Austrian rule, such as Trentino Alto-Adige, Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia the tradition of bomboloni is believed to have originated from that of Austrian \"krapfen\" (i.e., Berliner), and the recipe includes eggs, which are not found in the Tuscan variety.Pasticceries sometimes have handwritten signs for them, and food writer Emily Wise wrote that visitors might not be as taken with hot filled doughnuts in an area with wild boar salami and sandwiches with truffle oil on offer, but that residents of Tuscany enjoy them even at the beach.

It is especially associated with the port city of Livorno in Tuscany and the town of Viareggio to the north.It is a hearty stew consisting of several different types of fish and shellfish. According to one tradition, there should be five different types of fish in the soup, one for each letter c in cacciucco. A wide variety of Mediterranean fish and shellfish may be used, such as red gurnard, armored gurnard, scorpionfish (scorfano), small clams such as littleneck or manila, firm-fleshed fish such as monkfish or other whitefish, red snapper, John Dory, or grouper, mussels, shrimp, and calamari. Traditionalist chefs add a stone taken from the sea to the dish. Crabs, eels, cuttlefish, octopus, bream, mullet, or anything else caught that day might be used. A wide variety of other ingredients are used in the broth, including various vegetables (which might include onions, tomatos, leeks, zucchini, or yellow squash), spices (which might include garlic, aniseed, dried crushed red pepper, kosher salt, black pepper, parsley, thyme, or bay leaf) and other ingredients (which might include fish stock, tomato paste, vermouth, or wine, either white or red). There are many variants of cacciucco, varying by region and availability of ingredients.The dish is traditionally attributed to the Near East, which might be true, as the word cacciucco comes from the Turkish ka\u00e7ukli (\"bits and pieces\" or \"odds and ends\"), which reflects how the stew is made, from a variety of fish.Cacciucco is similar to other types of fish stew, such as the French bouillabaisse, Greek kakavia, Spanish zarzuela, and Portuguese caldeirada. Cioppino, another fish stew, was created by Italian-American fisherman in San Francisco, who used the local Dungeness crab in a variation of the cacciucco recipe.Pellegrino Artusi, in his classic 1891 cookbook, gave the following recipe:For 700 grams (about 1 1\/2 pounds) of fish, finely chop an onion and saute it with oil, parsley, and two whole cloves of garlic. The moment the onion starts to brown, add 300 grams (about 10 1\/2 ounces) of chopped from tomatoes or tomato paste, and season with salt and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong vinegar or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted in a large glass of water. Let boil for a few more minutes, then discard the garlic and strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including sole, red mullet, gurnard, dogfish, mantis shrimp, and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add a little olive oil, since the amount of soffritto was quite small. When the fish is cooked, the cacciucco is usually brought to the table on two separate platters: on one you place the fish, strained from the broth, and on the other you arrange enough finger-thick slices of bread to soak up all the broth.\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 \u2191 2.0 2.1 2.2 \u2191 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 \u2191 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 \u2191 5.0 5.1 5.2 \u2191 \u2191 \u2191"},{"id":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linguine","label":"Linguine","content":"Linguine (Italian pronunciation: [li\u014b\u02c8\u0261wi\u02d0ne], English \/l\u026a\u014b\u02c8\u0261wi\u02d0ni\u02d0\/) is a form of pasta \u2013 like fettuccine and trenette, but elliptical in section rather than flat.

It is also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes. Typically, pasta is a noodle made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked and served in any number of dishes. It can be made with flour from other cereals or grains, and eggs may be used instead of water. Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Chicken eggs frequently dominate as the source of the liquid component in fresh pasta.Most dried pasta is commercially produced via an extrusion process. Fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines, but today many varieties of fresh pasta are also commercially produced by large-scale machines, and the products are widely available in supermarkets.Both dried and fresh pasta come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known variably by over 1300 names having been documented. In Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with locale. For example the form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending on region and town. Common forms of pasta include long shapes, short shapes, tubes, flat shapes and sheets, miniature soup shapes, filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes. As pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta) cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment. A second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno in which the pasta incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked.Pasta is generally a simple dish, but comes in large varieties because it is a versatile food item. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, there is a general rule that must be observed. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The ratio of sauce to pasta varies according to taste and texture, however traditionally the sauce should not be excessive as the pasta itself must still be tasted. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread."},{"id":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza","label":"Pizza","content":"Pizza is an oven-baked flat bread generally topped with tomato sauce and cheese.

Originally from Sicily, it is available all over Italy in somewhat different forms. It is related to sorbet and Italian ice; however, in most of Sicily, it has a coarser, more crystalline texture. Food writer Jeffrey Steingarten says that \"the desired texture seems to vary from city to city\" on the island; on the west coast and in Palermo, it is at its chunkiest, and in the east it is nearly as smooth as sorbet. This is largely the result of different freezing techniques: the smoother types are produced in a gelato machine, while the coarser varieties are frozen with only occasional agitation, then scraped or shaved to produce separated crystals. Although its texture varies from coarse to smooth, it is always different from the one of an ice cream which is creamier, and from the one of a sorbet, which is more compact; this makes granita distinct and unique."},{"id":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Macaroon","label":"Macaroon","content":"A macaroon (\/m\u00e6k\u0259\u02c8ru\u02d0n\/ mak-\u0259-ROON) is a type of small circular cake, typically made from ground almonds (the original main ingredient) or coconut (and\/or other nuts or even potato), with sugar and egg white.

It is not known exactly how or when this dessert came to be, but some theories suggest that cream, for which mountainous Northern Italy is famous, was historically eaten plain or sweetened with fruit or hazelnuts. Earlier commercial recipes for the dish did not directly mention gelatin, but instead included a step in which fish bones were boiled; this is now known to extract collagen from the bones, which turns to gelatin. Home preparation has always used honey and egg whites, traditionally abundant in Italian homes, left over from the yolks used to enrich hand-made pasta and cakes. Sugar, later a main ingredient, would not have been widely available as it was an expensive imported commodity. After years this treat evolved, commercially, into what is now a gelatin dessert, flavoured with vanilla and topped with fruit or spices, and served chilled.Rather similar versions of this dish are found in Greece, France, and Finland."},{"id":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Torta_caprese","label":"Torta caprese","content":"Torta caprese is a traditional Italian chocolate and almond or walnut cake named for the island of Capri from which it originates.

Neutral alcohol is infused with the pressings from the herbs except vanilla. The liquid is distilled and then infused with pressed vanilla. In the final stage distilled water, refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol are blended with the base. Galliano has been formulated at both 60 proof (30% by volume) and 84.6 proof (42.3% by volume).Galliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavor with subtle citrus and woodsy herbal under notes.  The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavored liqueurs such as Sambuca, Pernod, or Anisette. It is used both as a digestivo (meant for drinking after heavy meals), and as an ingredient for cocktails, most notably the Harvey Wallbanger, Golden Cadillac, and Golden Dream. It is also used in a popular Brooklyn cocktail, Mr. October, which the New York Times notes, \"tastes like apple pie \u00e0 la mode, thanks to Galliano\u2019s vanilla notes.\"The Galliano brand is currently owned by Dutch distiller Lucas Bols, and marketed through its worldwide distribution joint venture, Maxxium. Galliano is packaged in a distinctively-shaped bottle, reminiscent of a classical Roman column. Several other liqueurs are also produced under the Galliano brand name, including a black Sambuca, a white Sambuca and an amaretto, which are predominantly distributed in Australasia, where the products are popular as shots.Galliano also makes Galliano Ristretto coffee flavored liqueur and Galliano Balsamico, a balsamic vinegar infused liqueur.
